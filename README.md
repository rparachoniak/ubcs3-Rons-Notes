# ubcs3-Rons-Notes
A collection of notes and exercises from the UBC Scientific Software Seminar to practice git, python, etc.

Here is an extra line I added via vim on Jupyter.

Here is another line added via web editor in Jupyter (now edited in github).

This is a line I added on git itself in the editor.

The notebook is named Rons-Github-Notebook.ipynb
